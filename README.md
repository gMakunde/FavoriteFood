## What was the theme you chose?
The theme that I chose for this project is israeli food. This is because I was in 
Israel for a month over winter break.

## How did you pick your searches to fit the theme?
I queried my three favorite foods in israel through the "Search Recipies" endpoint then put all the 
ids in the "Get Recipies Information Bulk" endpoint to get the information. 

## What are at least 3 issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?
